# Caching-Visualization-C-
This Project visualizes Caching by using a Grid of Pixels and Raylib with C++

This is a project i did for my Class, which is supposed to represent the speed up in processing time, when a n by n grid of pixels is hit at random without cache, at random with cache and in an algorithmic way with cache, this was all designed in raylib with an extra drawing library of mine.
